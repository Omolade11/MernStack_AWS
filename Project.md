# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (MERN STACK) IN AWS
In this project, we will implement a web solution based on the MERN stack in AWS Cloud.
MERN Web stack consists of the following components:
1. MongoDB: A document-based, No-SQL database used to store application data in a form of documents.
2. ExpressJS: A server-side Web Application framework for Node.js.
3. ReactJS: A frontend framework developed by Facebook. It is based on JavaScript, used to build User Interface (UI) components.
4. Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.

Project Prequisite: AWS EC2 instance, Postman and mLab for mongoDB database.
